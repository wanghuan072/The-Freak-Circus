## Game Overview

**The Freak Circus** is a psychological horror visual novel where you play as an ordinary worker who gets entangled in the story of a bizarre circus and several "non-human" characters.  
On the surface, it's about ambiguity and dependency; beneath lies control, obsession, and a tragedy that repeats itself.

- **Genre**: Visual Novel / Psychological Horror / Otome / Multiple Endings  
- **Status**: Free game (downloadable and playable)  
- **Main Story Structure**: Progresses by days (Day 1, Day 2, ...), with subsequent chapters being updated gradually  
- **Core Conflict**: The silent Pierrot, the dangerous Harlequin, the all-knowing Jester, and the legend of Columbina, known as "The Flower"

Every choice you make in Day 1—especially how you treat Pierrot—will affect the subsequent story progression and available routes.
