    Death Loop throws you into a high-stakes game of survival where trust is a luxury you can't afford. Ten strangers find themselves inexplicably bound together in a bizarre school, informed by a mysterious woman that a killer lurks in their midst. Their only hope of escape lies in identifying and eliminating the killer through a process of voting. However, failure comes with a dire consequence: death, followed by an immediate return to the start of the loop. With each reset, alliances shift, suspicions deepen, and the pressure mounts. The game masterfully combines the tension of social deduction with the narrative depth of a visual novel, creating an experience that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally gripping. Death Loop is not just about finding the killer; it's about understanding the motivations of everyone involved and making the right choices under immense pressure.
