        comment: "I love this game SOOOO much! The story is amazing, I love the characters, and Pierrot has RIPPED MY HEART OUT OF MY CHEST AND RAN AWAY WITH IT. (In a good way). I have never fallen in love with  a fictional character so quickly in my life. ü•πü•πü•πü•πü•π. I would love to see more of this!",
